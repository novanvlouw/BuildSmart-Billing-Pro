## Business Model Understanding

Based on client billing scenarios, the system handles complex licensing structures:

**Example: Multi-Year Licensing with Prorated Additions**
- Initial Contract: 10 licenses @ R 193,120 (July 2024 start)
- Year 2 (2025): 5.5% increase + 5 additional licenses for 5 months with prorated alignment
- Year 3 (2026): 6% increase + 5 additional licenses for full year
- Year 4+ (2027): 4.5% ongoing increases with consolidated billing

**Key Business Logic:**
- Anniversary-based billing alignment for perpetual clients
- Prorated additional licenses that align with contract anniversary
- Annual percentage increases applied to base + additional licenses
- Complex multi-year projections with varying license counts

## Recent Updates (Aug 2025)

- **Annual Increase Logic Overhaul**: 
  - Fixed carry-forward logic so increases apply consistently across years
  - Default state: 2025, 2026, 2027 show same values (no increases applied)
  - When increase set for 2026: both 2026 and 2027 get same increase until new one defined
  - Added ability to clear all increases and reset to base values
  - Enhanced UI with "Apply for 2026+" and "Reset" buttons
  - Automatic future year planning (when reaching 2026, system prepares for 2028)
- **Business Logic Corrections (Aug 2025)**:
  - Fixed perpetual S&M billing: Existing clients pay from Year 1 (no free year for original contracts)
  - Year 1 free policy now only applies to new additional licenses, not existing perpetual clients
  - Updated all rental model references from "Equipment" to "BuildSmart" for consistency
  - Corrected billing calculations to properly handle existing vs new license scenarios
  - Enhanced settings documentation to clarify S&M policy scope
- **Anniversary Month Fixes**: 
  - Fixed perpetual clients defaulting to January instead of actual deal start month

  - Enhanced billing calculations to use correct anniversary months (July, May, etc.)
- **Prorating Enhancements**: 
  - Improved additional license prorating calculations for perpetual clients
  - Fixed month calculations for licenses added before vs after anniversary dates

  - Added rentals configuration section with period, monthly factor, and security deposit settings
  - Integrated rentals into all billing calculations, analytics, and revenue projections

  - Enhanced start date-based billing calculations for rental clients
  - Added support for rental period billing (not all 12 months)
  - Implemented proper monthly value updates starting from specified start date
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed console logging for rental billing updates to track value changes
- **Fixed Client Edit Functionality**: Resolved issue where client editing wasn't working properly, now fully functional with pre-populated forms
- **Enhanced Action Button Visibility**: Changed all action icon colors to light grey for improved visibility and consistency  
- **Professional Notification System**: Replaced basic browser alerts with beautiful slide-in notifications featuring glass effects, animations, and auto-dismiss
- **Fixed Additional License Modal**: Corrected client dropdown in "Add Additional License" modal to show actual client names instead of "undefined"

- **Spelling Consistency**: Corrected all instances of "Installment" to "Instalment" throughout the system
- **License Distribution Analysis**: Added Instalment billing model to the license distribution pie chart
- **Graph Color Consistency**: Updated all chart colors to match the purple/slate theme consistently
- **Removed Stray Icon**: Removed floating key icon from Quick Actions block
- **Billing Overview Enhancements**: 
  - Fixed Monthly Billing Breakdown to show actual client revenue data instead of calculated projections
  - Created separate ZAR and USD Monthly Billing tables side-by-side for multi-currency analysis
  - Enhanced 6-Month Projections to use real client data and smart baseline calculations from recent months

  - Added detailed success notifications explaining billing timeline for perpetual clients
  - Ensured existing monthly billing data remains unchanged while properly calculating future S&M projections
  - Added automatic comment generation when additional licenses are added to track changes in Client management page
- **Perpetual Billing Model Logic**: 
  - Year 1: S&M is free for additional licenses only (existing contracts pay from Year 1)
  - Year 2: Additional licenses prorated from month after start to anniversary alignment
  - Year 3+: All licenses billed together for full 12 months at current year rates
  - Sophisticated handling: licenses added before anniversary pay partial year, after anniversary pay through next anniversary
  - Annual increases apply uniformly to base contracts and aligned additional licenses
- **Project Cleanup**: Removed unused development files for cleaner project structure
